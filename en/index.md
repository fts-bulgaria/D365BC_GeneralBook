# Executive summary

FTS Bulgaria provides completely localized version of Dynamics 365 BC,
translated into Bulgarian language, and in consistency with the
requirements of Bulgarian legislation. Part of the localization is the
General Ledger reporting.

The General Ledger reporting includes the following reports:

• General Ledger

• Chronological journal

# Settings for General Ledger reporting 

The data required for the preparation of the General Ledger Book are
stored in a separate table called **General Ledger Entry Balancing**.
The table contains the accounting records, which are registered in the
system at the end of the operations related to the recording the
documents. The table stores records only in cases when the module that
manages the use of the General Ledger Book is activated.

The data from the **General Ledger Entry Balancing** table can be viewed
in the **General Ledger Entry BA** window, which is activated from the
list of registered related records for each document in the system.
